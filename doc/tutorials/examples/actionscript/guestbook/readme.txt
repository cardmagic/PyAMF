Guestbook example
=================

This example shows how to create a simple guestbook
using Flex (client) and Twisted (remoting gateway).

Check the wiki page for more info:
http://pyamf.org/wiki/GuestbookExample

Please note that the Twisted and Genshi packages are required to
run this example. Genshi is only used to sanitize the incoming
html for the guestbook messages.

Install via setuptools:
	easy_install Twisted
    easy_install Genshi
