  What's New in PyAMF 0.6
**************************

:Release: 0.6
:Date: |today|

TODO: A description here of PyAMF 0.6.

Highlighted Features
====================

* The default AMF version has been switched from `AMF0` to `AMF3`.


Backward Incompatible API Changes
=================================

* ``__new__`` is used in favour of ``__init__``. See #700_
* ``pyamf.ClientTypes`` served no purpose and was not compliant with the
  AMF0 specification. It has been removed. See #651_ for more information.
* ``exceptions`` attribute has been removed from `Context` objects and
  :class:`pyamf.util.IndexedCollection`. Any method that used to raise
  :class:`pyamf.ReferenceError` will now return ``None`` for speed.
* ``amf3.Encoder.write*`` methods no longer accept ``use_references``.

Integration
===========

Django
------

* Empty relations are now encoded as ``None``, not :class:`pyamf.Undefined`.
* All ``model.Model`` fields are now encoded dynamically. See #677_

Google AppEngine
----------------
* All ``db.Model`` properties are now encoded dynamically. See #677

SQLAlchemy
----------

* All mapped properties are now encoded dynamically. See #677_
