Highlighted Features
====================

* None so far! :)


Backward Incompatible API Changes
=================================

* ``pyamf.ClientTypes`` served no purpose and was not compliant with the AMF0
  specification. It has been removed. See `#651 <http://pyamf.org/ticket/651>`_
  for more information.
* ``exceptions`` attribute has been removed from ``Context`` objects and
  ``pyamf.util.IndexedCollection``. Any method that used to raise
  ``pyamf.ReferenceError`` will now return ``None`` for speed.


Integration
===========


Django
------

* Empty relations are now encoded as ``None``, not ``pyamf.Undefined``.
